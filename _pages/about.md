Our research focuses on **system security**, **network security**, and **applied cryptography**.
Our know-how made major cont­ri­bu­ti­ons to the dis­co­very of critical se­cu­ri­ty flaws like [DROWN](https://drownattack.com/), [ROBOT](https://www.robotattack.org/), and [Efail](https://efail.de/).
We sys­te­ma­ti­cal­ly ana­ly­ze these vul­nerabi­li­ties and de­ve­lop tes­ting tools to iden­ti­fy and fix them.
One example is a tool for flexible analyses of TLS libraries: [TLS-Attacker](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/TLS-Attacker).
