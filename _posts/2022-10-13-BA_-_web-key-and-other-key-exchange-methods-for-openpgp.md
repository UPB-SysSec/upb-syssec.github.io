OpenPGP is a cryptographic protocol based on public-key cryptography.
It is used in various different application areas like securing mails, encrypting files, and validating the integrity and authenticity of exchanged files.
A design principle of OpenPGP is decentralization.
In contrast to cryptographic protocols utilizing the TLS public key infrastructure (e.g. S/MIME in the context of securing mails, or HTTPS for web), OpenPGP has no centralized trust anchors.

As direct (e.g. in person) key distribution and key validation do not scale, the OpenPGP ecosystem evolved two indirect concepts:

 * **key servers** for key distribution
 * the **Web of Trust** as a decentralized trust model for validating the authenticity of keys

It turned out, both concepts have fundamental problems:
 * Key servers do not verify uploaded keys.
   Everyone can upload keys for any e-mail address, which leads to different attack vectors.
   The "evil32" attack showed that it is very efficient to generate and upload keys with the same short fingerprint (the last 4 bytes of the full fingerprint).
   Users who check only the short fingerprint can not distinguish between the legitimate and the counterfeit key.
 * To make the "web of trust" possible, everyone can sign a public key to express that they have verified it.
   By massively signing and uploading a victimâ€™s key to a key server, the key size will grow steadily.
   As a result, a key with too many signatures (the specific amount depends on the used software) can not be processed anymore.
   Synchronizing key servers are practically only appending key material, which complicates mitigation of such attacks.
 * Not only manipulated keys, but also public keys where users no longer possess the corresponding private key, remain in the system.
 * It turned out, that only a fraction of the users of the "web of trust" can significantly profit from it.
   This is contrasted by the disclosure of personal data and the social graphs of the users, which can be derived from the key signatures.
 * The SKS key server network, which was used as the default key server in GnuPG, is no longer maintained and has been shutdown on 2021-06-21 due to privacy problems and legal problems resulting from the European General Data Protection Regulation.

An approach to improve this situation is Web Key Directory.
It provides a method to associate OpenPGP keys to a well-known URI and distribute them over HTTPS.
Web Key Directory incorporates security properties of the TLS ecosystem by the use of HTTPS for key exchange.
Trusting exchanged keys over this method, therefore, implies trusting in TLS and the (web)server responsible for the publication.



## In a nutshell: Web Key Directory
Web Key Directory (WKD) consists of two protocols, which will be briefly described here before presenting the results of the security analysis:

  1. The Key Discovery Protocol can be used to discover and receive OpenPGP keys published via the Web Key Directory.
  2. The Directory Update Protocol can be used to submit keys in an automated, e-mail driven way to the Web Key Directory.


### Key Discovery
Web Key Directory associates keys with their e-mail address.
These keys are provided by a webserver on the domain of the e-mail address.
To locate and request a key the client sends a GET request over an HTTPS secured connection to this webserver.
There are two variants of URIs, the *advanced* and the *direct* variant.

In the following we look briefly at the URI constructed for the e-mail address *Alice.Wonderland@example.org* in the advanced variant:

![An annotated example of a WKD URL. The domain is the 'openpgpkey' subdomain of the e-mail address domain. The last part of the path is the Z-Base-32 encoded SHA-1 hash of the lower-case local-part of the e-mail address. The GET parameter 'l' has the local-part of the e-mail address with URI percentage encoding as needed. The complete example URI is: https://openpgpkey.example.org/.well-known/openpgpkey/example.org/hu/5gt5gnaq1zccz7f19kq9whu4ezf1uofq?l=Alice.Wonderland](/assets/img/web-key-and-other-key-exchange-methods-for-openpgp_-_wkd-uri-advanced.svg){:width="100%" .wkd-dark-invert}

We see that most of the URI construction is pretty straight-forward.
Some attention should be lent to the last part of the path, which is the local-part of the e-mail address, mapped to lower-case, hashed and encoded in alpha-numerical characters (e.g. a hash of "alice.wonderland").
This is done in part to ease the implementation of WKD servers by ensuring this path element is always a valid file name without special characters that might be rejected for example by the webserver's operating system.
Furthermore, while assuming that the local-part of an e-mail address is always case-insensitive and thus can be mapped to lower case is not strictly RFC compliant, it reflects real-world usage of e-mail addresses and thus simplifies finding the key for an address.
If a Web Key Directory is provided for an e-mail server that distinguishes e-mail addresses by case, the WKD server has to make sure to check the verbatim local-part in the `l` parameter.

The direct URI is only used if the *openpgp* subdomain does not exist and is simply the advanced URI omitting the subdomain and the repetition of the e-mail address domain in the path.
The response to this HTTPS GET request is the OpenPGP key for the given e-mail address, regardless of URI variant.


### Update Protocol
The purpose of the e-mail driven update protocol is to automate and ease the publication process of OpenPGP keys to the Web Key Directory.
It is based primarily on OpenPGP secured e-mail exchange between the user and their Web Key Directory provider.

For the submission process, we need to know the submission e-mail address to which we submit our key and the OpenPGP key for that submission address.
The submission address is defined in a file which is served by the Web Key Directory webserver.
The corresponding key is treated like every other published key and can therefore be requested via the key discovery protocol.

To ensure that only the legitimate key owner can publish their keys, the update protocol uses a challenge-response mechanism.

![Exchanged e-mails in the WKD Update Protocol between user Alice and her WKD provider in a Message Sequence Graph. First, Alice sends a submission mail to her WKD provider. This submission mail is encrypted to the WKD provider and contains the key with one User-ID (e-mail address). Second, the WKD provider sends a confirmation request to the e-mail address of the submitted key (i.e. Alice). This confirmation request mail is encrypted to the submitted key and signed by the WKD provider. It contains the e-mail address, the fingerprint of the submitted key, and the nonce as a secret. Third, Alice sends a confirmation response back to the WKD provider. This confirmation response is encrypted to the WKD provider and signed by Alice. It contains the e-mail address and the nonce. Fourth, the WKD provider publishes the submitted key to the Web Key Directory and notifies Alice via an optional success mail.](/assets/img/web-key-and-other-key-exchange-methods-for-openpgp_-_wkd-update-protocol.svg){:width="100%" .wkd-dark-invert}

This mechanism is implemented via the confirmation request and confirmation response mails.
The confirmation request is sent to the e-mail address of the submitted key and is encrypted with the submitted key and signed by the WKD provider.
The major contents are the nonce as the secret (chosen randomly), and the e-mail address and fingerprint of the submitted key.
E-mail address and fingerprint can be used by the user to verify that the correct key should be published for the correct e-mail address.

The nonce is only accessible by the key owner because they should be the only person in possession of the corresponding private key and thus able to decrypt the nonce.
If the nonce is send back correctly, the server can assume that the key owner wants to publish the submitted key and makes the key available via the Web Key Directory.
The server can send an optional success message to the user.

The challenge-response mechanism has to be done with the person for which the key should be published for.
But how do we know that the key supposedly for *alice@example.org* is indeed from Alice and not from an attacker like Mallory?
The update protocol is based on the assumption that the WKD provider can securely deliver mail to the owner of the mail address without third-parties able to read its contents.
We will address this assumption below in the security analysis.



## Security Analysis
During the analysis, it became apparent that we had to distinguish between the Web Key Directory specification and the reference implementation in regard to the security implications.
Regarding the WKD specification we found one major concern in the lax and vague main assumption for the update protocol.
The *GnuPG* implementation of WKD is the only complete (i.e. discovery and update protocol) implementation we know about.
We found several implementation errors and faults in this implementation, which were not always security relevant.
However, a combination of two errors made it possible to find an attack which allowed us to completely compromise a Web Key Directory installation.


### Update Protocol Main Assumption
The main assumption regarding the security of the WKD Update Protocol reads as follows:

> The protocol defined here is entirely based on mail and the assumption that a mail provider can securely deliver mail to the INBOX of a user (e.g. an IMAP folder).

This assumption is vague and unclear.
It is neither clear which security properties are requested nor from whom.
E-mail infrastructure can be very complex.
An e-mail from a Web Key Directory provider to their user might take several hops before reaching its destination.

We created three scenarios how the e-mail infrastructure topology could look like and considered several interpretations of the main assumption.
We examined these interpretations with the topology scenarios and discussed their impact on the security of WKD.

Only in one interpretation we could find no attack points in any scenario.
This interpretation, however, was the most unrealistic: the assumption, that a mail provider can "securely" (i.e. at least confidentially) deliver e-mails to the inbox of the recipient user's mail client, even for recipients on other servers.

The security of the update protocol should not be based on a main assumption this vague.
Our discussion showed potential attack points which might also exist in real-world setups.
For details see Thesis Section 6.3.


### Implementation Errors and Faults
We found out that the reference implementation is not completely specification-compliant.
This is due to not implementing requirements of the specification correctly or at all.
In addition there are two MIME headers (`Wks-Phase`, `Wks-Draft-Version`) in each message of the reference implementation which are not specified.
These headers are not secured (e.g. integrity-protected) in any way.
Problematic is the use of the `Wks-Draft-Version` header because it makes the reference implementation mostly incompatible to specification-compliant implementations.
The reference implementation decides which WKD specification version is used for the processed mail based on this header.
If the header is missing the implementation assumes the "old" format (prior to specification draft version 2) is used which is partially incompatible with the "new" format.
Only the submission e-mail and the confirmation response seem to be backwards compatible, as the new versions only enforce aspects of the specification (MUST) which were already recommended (SHOULD) before.
However, this header could easily be changed and the protocol is therefore prone to downgrade attacks which could be a major problem for future protocol changes.

In addition, we found further conceptual and implementation errors like missing and incorrect signature generation and verification in the reference implementation.
The confirmation response may be sent unencrypted and attacker controlled data like `nonce` and `address` fields in the mails are not checked properly.


### Attack on the Update Protocol Implementation
Two of the above implementation errors enabled us to describe an attack which made it possible to publish OpenPGP keys for **any** e-mail address for **any** domain managed by a Web Key Directory provider.
Assume an attacker Mallory wants to publish a self generated key impersonating Alice to their WKD provider.
This attack has almost no assumptions:

 1. Victim Alice has an e-mail address like <alice@example.net>
 2. Attacker Mallory has an e-mail address like <mallory@example.org>
 3. The Web Key Directory provider uses
    * the GnuPG implementation
    * provides the WKD for both example.net and example.org
    * provides the WKD Update Protocol.

The attack also works with Alice and Mallory using e-mail addresses with the same domain.

The attack is demonstrated in the below picture of the update protocol run:

![Attack on the Update Protocol shown as a Message Sequence Graph. It is similar to the Message Sequence Graph for the WKD Update Protocol (from above) but users are Alice, Mallory, and the WKD Provider. Mallory submits a key and then participates in the challenge-response mails with the server. Alice receives only an encrypted confirmation request and the optional success message after successful publication of the submitted key. Parts in the graph which are changed by Mallory in comparison to the regular WKD Update Protocol run are highlighted. These are the submitted key which contains both a User-ID for Alice and for Mallory, as well as the changed address and nonce fields in the confirmation response.](/assets/img/web-key-and-other-key-exchange-methods-for-openpgp_-_wkd-update-protocol-attack.svg){:width="100%" .wkd-dark-invert}

Mallory submits a key to the WKD provider with two User-IDs (i.e. names/addresses assigned to the key): one User-ID for alice@example.net and one for mallory@example.org.
It turned out that the GnuPG implementation sends a confirmation request to each of these e-mail addresses.
Each of these contain the distinct e-mail address in the `address` field, a distinct `nonce`, and the same `fingerprint` (key is the same for both).
Mallory is in possession of the private key and can decrypt the confirmation request to send a confirmation response back to the server.
Mallory must achieve two goals to succeed:

  1. The server has to think the confirmation response is for a confirmation request for Alice
  2. The server has to see the nonce in the confirmation response as valid for a confirmation request for Alice.

The first goal is quite simple. The `address` field is not protected or checked and Mallory changes it simply in her confirmation response from mallory@example.org to alice@example.net.
The second goal is not that simple because Mallory does not know the nonce sent to Alice.
By digging into the source code we found that the nonce in the `nonce` field is not checked directly:
The nonce sent in the confirmation response is *not* compared with the nonce in the confirmation request.
Instead the existence of a file path created with the nonce is checked.
The path consists of the following: '**domain / "pending" / nonce**'.
The domain is taken from the `address` field, "pending" is a fixed string, and the nonce is the value of the `nonce` field.
Both parts are not checked.

So, great! We can bend the path to every location in the file system via a simple path traversal on the `nonce` field.

To understand how our path traversal has to look like, we will have to look at how the implementation handles submitted keys internally:

![A directory tree containing paths like example.net/pending/o3euik... and example.org/pending/7mpzp4..., with example.net being the domain used by Alice and example.org the domain used by Mallory.](/assets/img/web-key-and-other-key-exchange-methods-for-openpgp_-_wkd-directory.svg){:width="100%" .wkd-dark-invert}

The implementation can handle a Web Key Directory for multiple e-mail address domains.
Each domain has its own directory.
In this directory there is for example the `hu` directory which contains all published keys.
Submitted but not yet verified keys are stored in the `pending` directory and named after the nonce used in the confirmation request.

Mallory submitted a key with two User-IDs (one for Alice and one for her).
The complete key is stored twice:
once in the pending directory for example.net named after the nonce only send to Alice *(o3euik3tr3d6rjwr...)*;
once in the pending directory for example.org named after the nonce only send to Mallory *(7mpzp4cgkr5uy3bz...)*.

Based on the path creation and the file structure we can see that a path traversal string '**../../example.org/pending/**' has to be prepended to the nonce in the confirmation response.
The resulting path '**example.net/pending/../../example.org/pending/7mpzp4cgkr5uy3bz...**' exists and contains the full submitted key.
The implementation will then publish the key (with only the User-ID of Alice) as the key for *alice@example.net*.

Thus we have an attack to publish a key for *any* e-mail address of *any* domain on a Web Key Directory.
The path traversal indeed is only necessary if the domain used by Alice and Mallory differs. Otherwise the changed address field would be sufficient to accomplish the attack.
This issue has been fixed in GnuPG version 2.2.37.
