	abstract = {It is challenging to conduct a large scale Internet censorship measurement, as it involves triggering censors through artificial requests and identifying abnormalities from corresponding responses. Due to the lack of ground truth on the expected responses from legitimate services, previous studies typically require a heavy, unscalable manual inspection to identify false positives while still leaving false negatives undetected. In this paper, we propose Disguiser, a novel framework that enables end-to-end measurement to accurately detect the censorship activities and reveal the censor deployment without manual efforts. The core of Disguiser is a control server that replies with a static payload to provide the ground truth of server responses. As such, we send requests from various types of vantage points across the world to our control server, and the censorship activities can be recognized if a vantage point receives a different response. In particular, we design and conduct a cache test to pre-exclude the vantage points that could be interfered by cache proxies along the network path. Then we perform application traceroute towards our control server to explore censors' behaviors and their deployment. With Disguiser, we conduct 58 million measurements from vantage points in 177 countries. We observe 292 thousand censorship activities that block DNS, HTTP, or HTTPS requests inside 122 countries, achieving a 10{\textasciicircum}-6 false positive rate and zero false negative rate. Furthermore, Disguiser reveals the censor deployment in 13 countries.},

	abstract = {Nationwide Internet censorship threatens free and open access to communication and information for millions of users living inside of censoring regimes. In this paper, we show that this poses an even greater threat to the Internet than previously understood. We demonstrate an off-path attack that exploits a little-studied but widespread feature of many censoring infrastructures: residual censorship, in which a censor continues blocking traffic between two end-hosts for some time after a censorship event. Our attack sends spoofed packets with censored content, keeping two victim end-hosts separated by a censor from being able to communicate with one another. Although conceptually simple, this attack has several challenges, which we address. We demonstrate the feasibility of the attack through two studies: one to capture the current state of residual censorship, and another to actually launch the attack (against machines we control). We show that the attack can be launched despite stateful TCP tracking used by many censors, and that it also works against those who censor by null-routing. We will be making our code publicly available.},
